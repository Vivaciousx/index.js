From the first line i realised that using the plus symbol (+) can put two sentences from different line in a straigth line.
I also moticed that adding a space in between the last word and the last double quote eg.("second envotech ") creats a space between the two sentences.
True or False is classified as boo lean, a number is a number, alphabet is classified as a string, and details as an object in data types.
I noticed that the symbol (=) can be used to assign a string as reflected in line 10, where "nothing" is assigned to age.
i also noticed that typeof refers undeclared data as undefined rather than error
